3. do the same on the edit page
4. explore the favorite option
5. on the filtered list call add a thrid parameter that allows for a declaration on how long an individual list should be
6. spend time reorganizing and calrifiying the file structure
7. on the same note abive merge the tech list and tech edit form onto the same page
8. upon mods above the navBar should have a home (job detail: devided into pages upon exceeding a certain number (ex: 50) decided how and where this should be structured) (job creation page with form) (Home/Landing page with metrics and easy access filters (consider a link for easy email send (link in model?))) (tehc field list know and unkown (with a match rating systemn to display)) (profile/ user page)
9. consider are there any other pages that could be beneficial
10. match rating syustem based on tech could use more model design
